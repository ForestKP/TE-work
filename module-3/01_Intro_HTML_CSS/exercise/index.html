        <p>
            With a long history as a port town, Niigata became a free port following the Meiji Restoration.
             Niigata's city government was established in 1889. 
             Mergers with nearby municipalities in 2005 allowed the city's population to jump to 810,000. 
             The annexation of the surrounding area has also given the city the greatest rice paddy field acreage in Japan.
              On April 1, 2007, it became the first government-designated city on the Japan Sea coast of Honshu.
